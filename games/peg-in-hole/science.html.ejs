<h2> The Science </h2>

<p>
	In some circumstances, not only will it be nessecary to deliver a piece to a particular position, but in a particular orientation as well. This experiment explores the transport of an object to a location and orientation.

<p>
	<strong>Full-state</strong> sensing provides the most information, because it tells the position of all robots (200 numbers for 100 robots).


	<strong>Mean</strong> tells where the average position (just 2 numbers for all 100 robots), and knowing the <strong>variance</strong> adds only 3 additional numbers.

	The <strong>region-based mean and variance</strong> will add information by giving the mean and variance of the entire swarm and mean and variances for the robots close to each as well.
